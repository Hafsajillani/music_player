# Music Player Interface

This project creates a music player interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes the following key features:

- **Player Interface Setup:** The HTML file defines the structure of the player, including buttons for play, pause, next, and previous, a volume slider, and a song list.

- **Styling with CSS:** The CSS file styles the player, including the background, button styles, and layout adjustments for different screen sizes.

- **Dynamic Playlist Creation:** JavaScript dynamically creates the playlist by adding list items (`<li>`) to the playlist container (`<ul id="playlist-songs">`), with each list item representing a song in the playlist.

- **Event Handling:** Event listeners are added to elements to handle user interactions. For example, a click event listener is added to the play button to handle play/pause functionality.

- **Functions for Player Controls:** JavaScript defines functions for controlling the music player, such as `playAudio`, `pauseAudio`, `togglePlay`, `nextSong`, and `previousSong`. These functions modify the player's state and update the UI accordingly.

- **Updating UI:** JavaScript updates the UI based on the player's state. For example, when a song is playing, the play button changes to a pause button.

- **Responsive Design:** The JavaScript code includes responsive design considerations, such as adjusting the player and playlist size based on the screen width using media queries.

- **Song Information Display:** JavaScript updates the song title and artist information in the player display based on the currently selected song in the playlist.

This project demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional and interactive music player interface. Enjoy listening to your favorite tunes!
